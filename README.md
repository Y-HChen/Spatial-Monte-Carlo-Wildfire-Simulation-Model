# Spatial-Monte-Carlo-Wildfire-Simulation-Model
## Objective: To predict future landscape heterogeneity and fragmentation indices in response to high-severity wildfires over the next 100 years, and compare those predicted changes to observed patterns from the past decade.

### Simulation Area: Entire Northern Sierras & Southern Cascade region 
Sample/Analysis Area: Lassen and Plumas National Forests, Sierra Nevada, California
Rectangular shaped area of 413,132 acres

#### Step 1: Wildfire Data
Vegetation burn severity data was downloaded from the USDA and (MTBS)
Timeframe 1984 â€“ 2019 and 157 wildfires
Fires >1000 acres only
Only high-severity patches were used in simulations
#### Step 2: Spatial Monte Carlo Simulations in Python
Historic probability-based selection of the number of fires per year
Random selection of fire locations
Each historic fire with equal probability of selection
Historic fires moved to random locations and oriented randomly within the landscape. 
Repeated for 100 years, and 100 simulations.

#### Step 3: Simulation Clipped to Sample Area
